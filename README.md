# wartouch
Apply a 'scorched earth' policy to your bash touch. Or don't. It's dumb.

## What Is This And Why Did You Make It You Dumb F-
It's touch. It's touch but with deleting the file you want to touch to make sure it's empty. There is no explanation other than a dumb inside-joke. Stop judging me.


## How To
copy the `./wartouch` and `./wtouch` files to your /usr/bin directory like so:

`cp ./wartouch /usr/bin/wartouch`
`cp ./wtouch /usr/bin/wtouch`

make sure it's marked as executable

`chmod +x ./wartouch`
`chmod +x ./wtouch`
